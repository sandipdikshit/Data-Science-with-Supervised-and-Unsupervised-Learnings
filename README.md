#Task1-Prediction using Supervised ML 1.Problem statement-Predicting percentage of student by the number of hours of studying.So,what will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

2.Data-'https://bit.ly/w-data'

3.Features-attribute-"Hours",label-"Scores"

4.Evaluation- Mean-absolute-error

#Task2-Prediction using Unsupervised ML 1.Problem Statement-From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.

2.Data-: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox.The data contains flower Sepal and Petal dimensions. There are 150 entries and 4 features.

#Task3-Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm 1.Problem Statement-For the given ‘Iris’ dataset, create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly.

2.Data-: https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

3.Features-The independent features which can be used in training are SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm. The dependent feature which is the target variable is the species to which flower belongs to.

#Task4-STOCK MARKET PREDICTION USING NUMERICAL AND TEXTUAL ANALYSIS 1.Problem Statement-Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and sentimental analysis of news headlines
